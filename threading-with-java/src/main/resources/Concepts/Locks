Object level - on a non static method or non static block
                - synchronised on the method
                - synchronised(this/Object){

                }
Class level - static method, static code
                - synchronised on the method
                - synchronized(ClassName.class/static OBject){

                }

the synchronized keyword can be used only with static/non-static methods (not constructors)/code blocks.
    Avoid synchronizing non-final fields and String literals (instances of String created via new are OK)


Two threads can concurrently execute non-synchronized, synchronized static, and synchronized non-static methods.
