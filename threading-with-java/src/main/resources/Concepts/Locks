Object level - on a non static method or non static block
                - synchronised on the method
                - synchronised(this/Object){

                }
Class level - static method, static code
                - synchronised on the method
                - synchronized(ClassName.class/static OBject){

                }

the synchronized keyword can be used only with static/non-static methods (not constructors)/code blocks.
    Avoid synchronizing non-final fields and String literals (instances of String created via new are OK)


Two threads can concurrently execute non-synchronized, synchronized static, and synchronized non-static methods.

It is safe to call a synchronized method from another synchronized method of the same class that requires the same lock.
This works because synchronized is re-entrant (as long as it is the same lock,
the lock acquired for the first method is used in the second method as well).
